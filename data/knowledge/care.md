# Garment Care

- Dry clean couture pieces using delicate or hand-finish services only; avoid harsh solvents.
- Steam from the inside with a low-heat steamer and a pressing cloth to protect embellishments.
- Store gowns in breathable garment bags with structured hangers; lay heavily beaded skirts flat.
- Keep pieces away from direct sunlight and moisture. Silica packs are included with every delivery.
- For emergency spot cleaning, dab gently with distilled water and a mild fabric soap before consulting our atelier.
