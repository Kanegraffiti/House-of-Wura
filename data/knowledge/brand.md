# House of Wura Brand Story

House of Wura is a Lagos-based luxury fashion and event atelier that fuses Yoruba heritage with modern couture craftsmanship. The studio designs multi-sensory celebrations and couture wardrobes that feel intimate, artful, and deeply personal. Our team is led by creative director Wuraola Adeyemi, who believes every milestone deserves a cinematic reveal.

We partner with a small roster of artisans, set designers, florists, and lighting architects to build experiences that glow with gold accents, velvet textures, and curated storytelling. Every client engagement begins with a discovery call, followed by a moodboard, tactile material study, and timeline that maps fittings, rehearsals, and guest touchpoints.

Signature aesthetic pillars include luminous metallics, structured silhouettes softened with fluid draping, and atmospheric lighting that flatters dark skin tones. House of Wura also champions ethical sourcing, favouring women-led ateliers across West Africa and limited-run textiles. Each project concludes with a closing ritualâ€”a handwritten gratitude note and archival gallery to relive the celebration.
