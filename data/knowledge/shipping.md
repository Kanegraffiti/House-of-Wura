# Shipping & Delivery

- Lagos couture deliveries are hand-carried by the House of Wura concierge with final fittings on-site.
- Within Nigeria we partner with insured logistics firms offering 24â€“72 hour delivery once garments pass quality control.
- International shipments travel via DHL Express with full-value insurance and signature-on-delivery.
- Clients receive a digital wardrobe guide, care instructions, and a virtual styling session once the package ships.
- Rush requests under four weeks require approval and attract a 15% expedition fee to prioritise atelier capacity.
