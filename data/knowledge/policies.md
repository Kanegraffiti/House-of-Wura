# Policies

## Booking
- Dates are secured with a signed agreement and a 40% creative retainer.
- Remaining fees are split across milestone invoices: design sign-off, production start, and final rehearsal.
- Retainers are non-refundable but transferable within the same calendar year subject to availability.

## Communication
- WhatsApp is the primary channel for daily updates and concierge requests.
- Email recaps follow major meetings, fittings, or budget approvals within 24 hours.
- Emergency contacts are shared two weeks prior to live events for round-the-clock coverage.

## Vendor & Travel
- Preferred partners are sourced from our vetted network. External vendors must meet House of Wura quality benchmarks.
- Travel and accommodation for the core production team are billed at cost and due 14 days before on-site work begins.

## Changes & Cancellations
- Scope changes after design approval trigger a revised estimate and production timeline.
- Events postponed within 30 days of the live date incur a 20% rescheduling fee to secure vendors.
- Full cancellations require written notice; production costs already incurred will be invoiced.
