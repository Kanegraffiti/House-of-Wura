# Sizing Guidance

House of Wura garments follow a hybrid measurement chart developed for West African silhouettes. Core ready-to-wear sizes cover UK 6â€“20. Bespoke pieces are drafted from client measurements captured during fittings or via our virtual measurement kit.

Key measurements requested for couture orders:
- Bust, waist, hip, and hollow-to-hem in centimetres.
- Bicep, outseam, and desired heel height for gowns.
- Shoulder span, torso length, and inseam for tailored suits.

For virtual clients we ship a measurement tape and digital form. A dedicated stylist reviews submitted measurements before fabric cutting. Alterations are included in bespoke commissions up to two weeks after final delivery.
