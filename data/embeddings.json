    "text": "# House of Wura Brand Story\n\nHouse of Wura is a Lagos-based luxury fashion and event atelier that fuses Yoruba heritage with modern couture craftsmanship. The studio designs multi-sensory celebrations and couture wardrobes that feel intimate, artful, and deeply personal. Our team is led by creative director Wuraola Adeyemi, who believes every milestone deserves a cinematic reveal.\n\nWe partner with a small roster of artisans, set designers, florists, and lighting architects to build experiences that glow with gold accents, velvet textures, and curated storytelling. Every client engagement begins with a discovery call, followed by a moodboard, tactile material study, and timeline that maps fittings, rehearsals, and guest touchpoints.\n\nSignature aesthetic pillars include luminous metallics, structured silhouettes softened with fluid draping, and atmospheric lighting that flatters dark skin tones. House of Wura also champions ethical sourcing, favouring women-led ateliers across West Africa and limited-run textiles. Each project concludes with a closing ritual—a handwritten gratitude note and archival gallery to relive the celebration.\n"

External vendors must meet House of Wura quality benchmarks.\n- Travel and accommodation for the core production team are billed at cost and due 14 days before on-site work begins.\n\n## Changes & Cancellations\n- Scope changes after design approval trigger a revised estimate and production timeline.\n- Events postponed within 30 days of the live date incur a 20% rescheduling fee to secure vendors.\n- Full cancellations require written notice; production costs already incurred will be invoiced.\n"

    "text": "# Sizing Guidance\n\nHouse of Wura garments follow a hybrid measurement chart developed for West African silhouettes. Core ready-to-wear sizes cover UK 6–20. Bespoke pieces are drafted from client measurements captured during fittings or via our virtual measurement kit.\n\nKey measurements requested for couture orders:\n- Bust, waist, hip, and hollow-to-hem in centimetres.\n- Bicep, outseam, and desired heel height for gowns.\n- Shoulder span, torso length, and inseam for tailored suits.\n\nFor virtual clients we ship a measurement tape and digital form. A dedicated stylist reviews submitted measurements before fabric cutting. Alterations are included in bespoke commissions up to two weeks after final delivery.\n"
