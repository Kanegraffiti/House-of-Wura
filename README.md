# House of Wura

House of Wura is a luxury event styling and fashion concierge experience built on a modern React stack:

- **Next.js 14** with the App Router, server actions, and Edge routes for API endpoints.
- **TypeScript** for end-to-end type safety across components, API handlers, and utilities.
- **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for composable, accessible interface primitives tailored to the brand.
- **Framer Motion** and bespoke animation helpers for polished transitions and micro-interactions.
- **Vercel Blob Storage** for persisting customer orders and proof-of-payment uploads.
- **OpenAI embeddings** to power product search and concierge flows via the included scripts.

The project is deployed on **Vercel**, leveraging automatic image optimization, serverless functions, and CDN edge caching.
